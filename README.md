# Data
## Why do we need this data set instead of using the other one.

# Abstract
## What is it?
## How can it be used by the researchers

# Specifications Table

# Value of the Data
- How would the reader benefit from this data.
- Class Metrics + Project Metrics
- Metrics: Maven Reuse
- Types: CK and SM

# Data Set
## Major Issues
1. [Issue](https://github.com/reusability/extract/issues/21): Check monorepo based data sets e.g [spring-framework](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework)
2. [Issue](https://github.com/reusability/extract/issues/22): Evolutionary Data Set (multiple release data set from the same project)

## Minor
1. [Issue](https://github.com/reusability/extract/issues/23): Retrieve both CK + SM (figure out a way to combine them)
2. Append Maven Reuse
3. Fetch all the different metrics like Class, Project, Package.

# Question for Chong
- Should we aggregate the data? 
- And if aggregating, then should we aggregate all the repositories Maven Reuse a for monerepo?
