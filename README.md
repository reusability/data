# Data
## Why do we need this data set instead of using the other one.

# Abstract
## What is it?
## How can it be used by the researchers

# Specifications Table

# Value of the Data
- How would the reader benefit from this data.
- Class Metrics + Project Metrics
- Metrics: Maven Reuse
- Types: CK and SM


# Data Set Fix
1. Check monorepo based data sets e.g [spring-framework](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework)
2. Evolutionary Data Set (multiple release data set from the same project)
3. Retrieve both CK + SM (figure out a way to combine them)
4. Append Maven Reuse
5. Fetch all the different metrics like Class, Project, Package.
